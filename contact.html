            <h2>Campus Visit and Information Sessions</h2>
            <p>We strongly encourage prospective students to visit our campus and attend one of our regular information sessions. These sessions provide an excellent opportunity to learn about our programs, meet faculty and current students, tour our facilities, and get answers to your questions about admissions, financial aid, and career outcomes. Information sessions are held every Tuesday and Thursday at 6:00 PM, and Saturday mornings at 10:00 AM. No appointment is necessary, but we appreciate advance notice if you plan to attend.</p>

            <p>For those who cannot attend our regular information sessions, we are happy to arrange individual campus tours and meetings with admissions counselors. Simply call our admissions office or use the contact form above to schedule your visit. We can also arrange meetings with program directors and faculty members if you have specific questions about particular academic programs or career paths.</p>
